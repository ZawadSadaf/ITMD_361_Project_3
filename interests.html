      <h3>Here is my Recipe for my cup of Milk Tea</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Firstly it varies based on what I have with me. I usually use boiling water and tea bags (usually 2 tea bags
          minimum for stronger flavor) to simmer my tea. In Bangladesh, people usually simmer the tea leaves in a
          boiling
          pot with boiling water but I mainly use tea bags for convenience</li>
        <li>I then use either condensed milk or creamer. I sometimes used dehydrated milk and just milk in general but
          then I would do a optional third step</li>
        <li>This step is optional in case your milk does not have a sweetner, in this case, I either use sugar or honey
        </li>
        <li>Now we stir everything and wait 10 minutes, after which we enjoyed after freshly made morning cup of tea :)
        </li>
      </ol>
